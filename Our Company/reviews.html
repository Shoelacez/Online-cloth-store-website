            "The Nicest Suits!

            My now fiancé was in his father’s wedding and they wore suits from here! 
            They had a variety of colors and styles to choose from! 
            Absolutely loved how handsome he looked in it!"<br /><br />

            "Perfect experience!

            My husband looked so handsome in his clean and classic black tux! 
            Big thanks to JFW for having such an extensive inventory for us to choose from! 
            Highly recommend"<br /><br />

            "My groom ordered all the tuxes from Gents Suits through my bridal boutique in Roswell, GA.
             The process was fairly simple as the team at the boutique walked him through all of the 
             detailed pricing and gave him a form to send to his groomsmen and the fathers to get
            measured as they were all out of town. Each got their measurements in and requests for pant 
            type for the groom and groomsmen slim fit pants and for the fathers standard and pleated. We also ordered the child size version of the same tux for our two ring bearers"<br /><br />
            "Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath
            ever!"<br /><br />

            "Terrible customer service. They delivered the tux late and an entire leg on the pants wasn't even hemmed!
            It was a foot longer than the other leg. Not to mention pocket squares and cuff links were missing 
            and for most of the groomsmen, the color on the tux was WRONG. Way overpriced. $250 dollars for a 
            tux rental that isn't even tailored or remotely the correct size 
            (sent us a 37 pant when we input 31 as the size online). And then refused to give a full refund. 
            Horrendous customer service."
