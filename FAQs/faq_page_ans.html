            Currently we are lacking a doorman and a Fitting room overseer, 
            We really wish that the applicants to that vacancy are physically fit 
            because the last guy who was on that position had some severe issues 
            resulting from standing for long durations and alot of movements. <br>

            to promote our company overseas.
